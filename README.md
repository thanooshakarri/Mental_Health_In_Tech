# Final project

-----------
[**Please delete these instructions before submitting the final version of your report**]

Welcome to your final project repo. Please make sure to follow the instructions posted in D2L. Don't forget: ONE repo per group.

1. Complete this README file with relevant information on the project. Find details on the usual stucture of README files [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes).
2. Make sure that the the LICENSE file is appropiate given the scope and data hosted in this repo for your project. You can find more information [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository).
3. Since you are the owner of the repo, please give admin access to your partner. I expect each group member to contribuite ~similarly to this repo.
4. Enjoy working on your final project and do get in touch if you have any questions!

## What the project does?
This project is based on the mental health data of people who are working in the industry. This project uses the machine learning model to predict if the person needs treatment for their mental health or not.

## Why the project is useful?
The tech industry is a rapidly growing industry with a high prevalence of mental health problems, such as stress and burnout, which can have negative impacts on employee productivity and wellbeing. This study aimed to gain insight into the mental health status of individuals working in the tech sector and to create a model that can accurately predict whether a person needs therapy.
