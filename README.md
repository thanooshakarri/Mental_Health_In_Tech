# Final project
## Mental Health in Work Space

## What the project does?
This project is based on the mental health data of people who are working in the industry. This project uses the machine learning model to predict if the person needs treatment for their mental health or not.

## Why the project is useful?
The tech industry is a rapidly growing industry with a high prevalence of mental health problems, such as stress and burnout, which can have negative impacts on employee productivity and wellbeing. This study aimed to gain insight into the mental health status of individuals working in the tech sector and to create a model that can accurately predict whether a person needs therapy.
