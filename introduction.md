# Introduction
Tech industry is a fast-pacing industry and so, the people working in this industry go through an increased levels of pressure in order to meet the growing demands of the digital age. Many other factors also impact the mental health of employees like extended work hours, gender pay gap, less employee benefits and so on. Mental health became an important factor impacting the overall well-being of humans especially in the Tech firms. 
The data is collected from a survey conducted in Tech firms all over the world collecting information about the demographic data and the type of work environment they are working in. This data can be used to classify if a person requires treatment or not. 


We are planning to model the data using different classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forest and choose the model that performs the best among others. 
The knowledge gap we have is that we don't know the details about the workload and the work-life balance of the employees which might be factors affecting the mental health. We also don't entirely know the accuracy and credibility of the data as the respondents may not be comfortable to share their concerns. Also, a part of the data collected is not entirely complete like the comments attribute in the dataset, which has more than 50% of the data missing.
